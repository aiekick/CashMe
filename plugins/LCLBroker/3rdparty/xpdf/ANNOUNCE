Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 4.05 - a PDF viewer and related tools

Glyph & Cog, LLC is pleased to announce a new version of Xpdf, the
open source Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer.  The Xpdf project
also includes a PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and
various other utilities.

Xpdf uses the Qt toolkit and runs on Linux and Windows.  The
non-graphical components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) run on Linux,
Unix, Windows, MacOSX, and pretty much any other system with a decent
C++ compiler.

4.05 is primarily a bug fix release.  There are some new features:

* New command line options/features:
  - Added the '-overwrite' option to pdftohtml.
  - Added the '-custom' flag to pdfinfo.
  - Added the '-meta' flag to pdftohtml.
  - Added the 'uses JavaScript' output to pdfinfo.

* New configuration options:
  - Added the 'ignoreWrongSizeToUnicode' xpdfrc setting.
  - Added the zoomScaleFactor xpdfrc setting.
  - Added the zoomValues xpdfrc setting.
  - Added the separateRotatedText xpdfrc setting.
  - Added the allowLinksToChangeZoom xpdfrc setting.

* XpdfReader improvements:
  - Added the loadSession and saveSession commands, and the 'Load last
    session' menu item.
  - Added code to automatically save and restore the xpdf session
    under control of a session manager.  (This has not been thoroughly
    tested yet.)
  - Added a 'smart case' option for search in xpdf.
  - Added a color/gray/mono switch to the 'save image' dialog.

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list of changes.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for Linux and Windows.
